class ProcessTracks():

    '''
        This class is responsible for building a data structure of tracks from various input dataframes, 
        namely the following : 
        - likes_dislikes_df
        - play_activity_df
        - identifier_infos_df
        - library_tracks_df

        With this class, we identify characteristics of the tracks listened to, and for each of them
        we create and update a instance of the Track class (see Track module for more details).
        Going through the rows of each input dataframe, we try to identify the songs that may
        represent the same track but with different titles, its associated genres, for each artist
        all the songs listened to, etc.

        Args:
            There is no argument to pass to instantiate the class.
        
        Attributes: 
            increment (int) - used to assign a unique id to each track instance
            track_instance_dict (dict) - used to keep track of the title/artist combination with the ref of the associated track instance
            artist_tracks_titles (dict) - used to keep track of all the titles of an artist, including different spellings of the same title
            genres_list (list) - used to keep track of all the unique values of genres
            items_not_matched (dict of lists) - used to keep track of the rows that were not matched in all dataframes processed,
            with the following format
                {'library_tracks':[], 'identifier_info':[],'play_activity':[], 'likes_dislikes':[]}

        Methods:
            __init__()
            get_track_instance_dict()
            get_artist_tracks_titles()
            get_genres_list()
            get_items_not_matched()
            get_increment()
            update_track_instance(origin_df, track_instance, index, row)
            compare_titles_for_artist(artist, title_to_compare)
            process_library_tracks_df(library_tracks_df)
            process_identifier_df(identifier_infos_df)
            process_play_df(play_activity_df)
            process_likes_dislikes_df(likes_dislikes_df)           

        The methods that parse each df can be called seperately, but only process_library_tracks_df and process_play_df will create
        new instances of Track (the other can only update existing instances). Besides, process_identifier_df requires that the
        existing instances of Tracks have their attribute apple_music_id populated, so it should be executed after processing
        the library_tracks_df.
        Therefore it makes sense to call the methods in this order (2 and 3 can be swapped):
            1. process_library_tracks_df(library_tracks_df)
            2. process_identifier_df(identifier_infos_df)
            3. process_play_df(play_activity_df)
            4. process_likes_dislikes_df(likes_dislikes_df)

class TrackSummaryObject():

    '''
        This class is responsible for building two main types of objects using the data structure of tracks
        constructed by Process.ProcessTracks :
        - count dictionaries
        - dataframe index / track instance matching dictionary
        
        The dataframe index / track instance matching dictionary is used to be able to add information
        from the track instances to any of the input dataframes, at the relevant rows. For example, we may
        want to add a pointer to the track instance in a df, or add the rating associated to the track to 
        a dataframe that doesn't contain this information. 
        As part of building the data structure of tracks, we keep track of the "appearance" property,
        that matches the dataframe name with the index we saw the track in.

        Args:
            ------ For the instance
            The attributes of a ProcessTracks class

            reference of the associated track instance
            artist_tracks_titles - dictionary that contains the artist name as a key and an array of titles
            associated to this artist
            genres_list - list of all the unique values of genres
            items_not_matched - dictionary of the following structure listing all the indexes associated
            with each df processed
